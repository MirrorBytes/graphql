<h1 align="center">üï∏ Add GraphQL to Svelte</h1>

## ‚ùì What is this?
This is an **experimental** command to run to add a GraphQL server (powered by [`graphql-helix`](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix/)) to your Svelte project generated with `create-svelte`.

## üõ† Usage
You must start with a fresh copy of the official `create-svelte` template, which is currently created by running this command. **You must say yes to TypeScript preprocessing.**
```sh
npm init svelte@next
# By the way, please listen to its warnings that SvelteKit is an alpha project
# https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit#When_can_I_start_using_it
```

Finally, run this command in your project directory to set up GraphQL:
```sh
npx use-preset babichjacob/svelte-add-graphql --no-ssh
```

After the preset runs,
* You can create a GraphQL schema in `src/routes/_graphql/schema.ts` using any library or technique you want. Additionally, you can set the `defaultQuery` that shows up when GraphiQL is loaded in the browser.

* You can query your API (with POST requests) at the `/graphql` endpoint.

* You can visit GraphiQL in the browser at the `/graphql` endpoint.

* You can see an example of how you may set up resolver-specific authorization with the `contextFactory` line in `src/routes/graphql.ts` and the `authorization` argument in `src/routes/_graphql/schema.ts`.

* The `/` route (in your `src/routes/index.svelte` file) will show an example of how to use your GraphQL API in `preload`.

* You [*cannot* use GraphQL subscriptions](https://github.com/babichjacob/svelte-add-graphql/issues/1).
